## Securitybot plugins
This directory contains a set of plugins for various alerting and logging systems that can be used to send alerts to the bot and also look up their results later.

Each plugin probably requires some amount of tweaking to make sure that it works for your group, but otherwise most should be development-environment agnostic.
